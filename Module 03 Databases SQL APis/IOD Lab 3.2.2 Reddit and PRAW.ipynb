So if you are using an ide, a web browser, literally any other program on your computer, they can use up cpu which means that your python program has less cpu it can reasonably use before it has to share with those programs and start to slow down. If you are using a windows computer, then task manager is a good thing to look at to see if cpu is maxing out.\n","`print(\"Finished in: \", time.perf_counter(), \"seconds\")` won't print the time it took to process.
